History
Infosys was founded by seven engineers in Pune, Maharashtra, India. Its initial capital was $250.[9] It was registered as Infosys Consultants Private Limited on 2 July 1981.[10] In 1983, it relocated to Bangalore, Karnataka.

The company changed its name to Infosys Technologies Private Limited in April 1992 and to Infosys Technologies Limited when it became a public limited company in June 1992. It was renamed Infosys Limited in June 2011.[11]

An initial public offering (IPO) was floated in February 1993 with an offer price of ₹95 (equivalent to ₹580 or US$7.30 in 2020) per share against a book value of ₹20 (equivalent to ₹120 or US$1.50 in 2020) per share. The IPO was undersubscribed but it was "bailed out" by US investment bank Morgan Stanley, which picked up a 13% equity stake at the offer price.[12] Its shares were listed in June 1993 with trading opening at ₹145 (equivalent to ₹890 or US$11 in 2020) per share
